# had to rollback to 1.22 to avoid this error : 
sudo pip install urllib3==1.22

## Was seeing this error : Importerror: cannot import name 'is_list_like
## This was fixed in #520 and will be a part of the next release (0.7.0). For now, I had to use the dev version
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/pydata/pandas-datareader
